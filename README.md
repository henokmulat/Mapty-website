# Mapty

Mapty is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to log and visualize their workouts on an interactive map.  
It combines geolocation, local storage, and object-oriented programming concepts to demonstrate modern JavaScript in action.

## Overview

The Mapty app lets users:
1. View their current location on a map (using the Geolocation API)
2. Log new workouts (running or cycling) by clicking on the map
3. Store all workout data persistently using Local Storage
4. Display workout details both on the map and in a sidebar list
5. Automatically zoom to workout locations

It’s a fully client-side project — no backend, database, or external server is required.
